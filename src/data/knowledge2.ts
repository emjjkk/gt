each headed by a church elder. On this particular occasion, the group to which I belonged was headed by an elderly man who after making sure everything was ready, now called for a prayer to bless the food. He made everybody to close their eyes and before he could finish the prayer, there was no food left; it had all been consumed. There and then we all fled in different directions, leaving the poor old man alone and agape. That was how far our belief went on Christian induction then.

During that period, the faith of our parents was not really deep and convincing because they indulged in visiting and interacting with bhalatvo and alfas each time they had problems, their membership and position in church notwithstanding. When we grew up and became independent, our belief and faith was not at all in Jesus Christ or the Almighty God even though we all agreed that there is a Supreme Being that created the earth in its fullness. We can therefore liken ourselves to those Athenians addressed by Paul the Apostle in Acts 17:23- 24 which says: For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.

God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.

## A Christless Entry into Adulthood

When I attained adulthood, and was practically on my own, I stopped attending church in the way I was brought up. I will go to work five days in a week and spend Saturdays roaming about the streets and visiting friends. On Sunday, I will sleep till around 11.00 a.m., get my needs for the following week and wait till evening time to attend the "tea- time- dance" at a popular resort, and return home to sleep around 10.00 p.m. That was my routine.

One day however, things took a new turn when I was invited by my uncle's wife to their church on a New Year eve. I honoured the invitation and she was very happy that I came, (as if I was not a Christian). During the service, she gave out two cubes of sugar each to all his family including myself, with an instruction that as soon as they usher in the New Year,

## My Life in Britain

The trend continued until when I found myself in UK where the environment coupled with the antecedent on ground made it more convenient for me not to attend church services. Most of the church buildings have been reduced to mere monuments but life there was so pleasant and devoid of unnecessary anxiety, that you do not have to go to church every Sunday, talkless of week days that is the order of the day in Nigeria.

The reasons for this is not far fetched, and include:

1. They were lucky to have leaders and governments that are caring and understand the needs of their people, consider and respect their opinion.

6 2. They were guided by God's injunctions that described who your brothers and sisters are: Matthew 25:35-36. 3. They practised and held onto the adage of "do unto others what you wish them do to you." 4. They were the embodiment of what God really requires of every human being in so many aspects.

The opposite is the case in Nigeria inspite of the ever- increasing churches and mosques. During my student days in UK, I attended church only during the christening ceremony of my children. The vicar on each occasion had to make several visits before the fixed dates to make sure we had not changed our minds. That was how far my religion went till I returned to Nigeria.

Please excuse my digression. I am only trying to lead readers to how I became a member of the Celestial Church of Christ, and how practical Christianity can be of benefit to devotees. Apparently, when I returned to Nigeria, all the high hopes and spirit that followed me home were dashed and everything began to fall apart. Little did I realize at that time that one of the best period of my life was the one I spent in the UK.

Life ambition and expectation began to crumble. Advices and suggestions were given to seek the help of herbalists, babalawos and alfas because the belief was that what was happening to us was the handiwork of evil forces.

So many solutions were proffered but all to no avail. I was made to do certain things that I later found to be stupid and weird considering my exposure in life. I was told to recite some funny incantations coupled with the use of perfumes of very offensive odours, believing that any reasonable person would want to look at me twice, much more permit me to stay and talk to him. Those responsible for these directives are not to blame, because, I was looking for the living among the dead. (Psalm 115:14- 18)

## Things Fall Apart

The situation became worse and was getting to a saturation point. I was at this time advised to seek spiritual assistance from gospel and Pentecostal churches. I started with individuals who would perform prayers and spiritual acts in their private residences and sometimes took me to mountain tops (Ori- Oke, as it is referred to). I was into so many of them because of my lack of knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, which could have enlightened and guided me of the warning of our Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 24:23- 28.

I will like to share this experience with my readers about a particular man I was introduced to by a friend. He was said to be making waves, so I went to him. My wife and children were in this church with some of our friends who like me; were seeking prosperity

and not God. Ignoring what Jesus Christ said in Matthew 6:33- 34, I decided to go to an intermediary without knowing where his power is derived from.

The church continued to grow. We spent a lot of times in clapping and singing. This usually ended up with visions and prophesies by the leader of the church, which in most cases were directed towards promoting his own ego. Sometimes he will call on some prominent members of the church to come and see the penny coins they were dropping in the collection plates to protest their miserly effort into the collection drive. Sometimes, this episode usually ended by 'mimicking and humiliating the men' all in the name of being a spiritual leader. A case of intellectual mediocrity.

Things came to a head and the true position of the church became manifested, when the leader was in conflict with a young member of the church over the love for a young girl. The attention of the congregation was drawn to the situation when every time we were in a singsong spree, the two of them will start talking in strange languages (mystic expressions) in a very loud and aggressive manner. Little did we know that they were accusing and abusing each other over the issue of this girl.

This in turn affected the church services that

===== Page 3 =====

10 Pastoral Chnstivity: The Celsial Chnst of Chnst Expttect somebody went and drew the attention of the founder to the happenings in the church. Before then we thought the church belonged to this church leader.

It was revealed that the church leader had never made returns to the founder, so he was asked to leave but he was adamant. That was when the founder sent some people to come and remove everything from the church including doors, windows and the planks. Most of us left and I considered it a good riddance of a bad rubbish. After this, I stayed at home with my family. Although occasionally we got involved with other churches, but this time to a lesser degree because through previous experience, I became wiser.

## Introduction to the Celestial Church of Christ

Although things began to improve a bit, but like every human being, I was not satisfied and I could not wait. I wanted a miracle.

I had a group of friends at the time and our usual practice was to go pub- crawling. We had some selected joints where we drink and relax after the day's work. Every time we go drinking; it was usually our habit to go in one car. Therefore we rotate cars amongst ourselves to minimise cost. There was a particular friend who each time it was his turn to take us out, had the habit of hurrying us up whenever we were at the peak of enjoying ourselves. I was one day compelled to ask him why the hurry every time it was his turn. He replied that he usually drops his wife at a place and it is mandatory that he should collect

===== Page 4 =====

12 Pracical Clnstiviy: The Celsial Chuch of Chist Expeice

her at a fixed time. That settled my curiosity and I was satisfied.

However, events became clear after a visit to my friend's house in company of my wife. During a chitchat among the wives, it was revealed to my wife that they belonged to a church organisation, which is very good and outstanding. She said she was sure her husband will not tell me because he did not like the church because of their many strict rules and regulations which he could not abide with. One of such rules is abstinence from alcohol.

As would be expected, my wife took everything hook, line and sinker and an arrangement was made between them to visit the church. At home, we had a lengthy discussion about this development and agreed that she should go and first visit the church alone before we can all agree to go there with her. By that time, I had decided not to get involved with any of these white garment churches again.

After each attendance, my wife would come home with one glorious news after the other of how wonderful the church is. I became reluctant when she was asked to perform one ritual or the other and I was compelled to take her there. Soon, I started, like my friend, dropping my wife at the church to collect her later. One Saturday however, as I vividly remember, my wife was required to carry out a ritual.

I had to take her there, wait until she finished and take her back home before I could go about my other appointments.

It was my habit to stay away from the church, so that I do not get involved in whatever they did. By this, I always stayed with one shoemaker, a very humble and pleasant man who I later discovered to be a member of this church called the Celestial Church of Christ (CCC). His house was right opposite the church at Makoko.

His name is Leader Onimale; he was also the treasurer of the church at that time. This leader was influential to my becoming a member of the CCC not by coercion but by persuasion and words of encouragement to my wife and me about not wanting to get involved. He was so convinced that the God of CCC would make it possible when the time is ripe. How right he was! If he is still alive, may the blessing of God be upon him and his offspring. May his soul, if dead, continue to rest in peace.

It was one of such occasions that a CCC prophet (there were very few of them at that time) was delivering prophetic messages in the church and was making a particular reference to a man within the church premises to come inside. Several people were ushered in and on each occasion they were turned

down. I did not know what was happening and in any case, I considered myself the last to be so invited. It was like what happened in 1st Samuel 16:8- 13. Then my wife mentioned that it could be me, because she was with them inside the church. It was then that one of the adena or wardens as they are referred to, came to usher me in. As soon as I came into his presence, the prophet started pouring out messages. Out of the several messages uttered, the one that attracted my attention and curiosity was when he prophesied that he saw me airborne and that very soon, I should be travelling abroad.

## 6

## I Joined the Celestial Church of Christ

This prophecy was delivered on Saturday, and it began to manifest on Monday (John 4:48). I was at that time the current President of the Federation of the Building and Civil Engineering Contractors in Nigeria having been elected earlier as the first indigenous president. This body coordinates and represents the interest of many major construction firms in Nigeria. Before then, the organization was dominated by expatriate contractors, since most indigenous contractors did not want anything to do with it.

Part of my schedule as the President was to visit the organisation's secretariat at least twice a week to

===== Page 6 =====

17

see if there was any urgent matter requiring attention and if so, to call an emergency meeting. It was during one of such routine visits on the fateful Monday that I was informed by the Assistant Secretary that they received a letter from NECC to a tripartite conference in Geneva, Switzerland by International Labour Organisation and that the Federation should be represented by the president and the secretary. I asked when the letter came and I was surprised to know that the letter had come for a while but was deliberately hidden from me by the secretary, because he would prefer the past president to me to attend the conference.

Things took a dramatic turn that day when I visited the secretariat and the Assistant Secretary suspecting that it might be too late and the federation would miss the opportunity decided to intimate me with it. I called an emergency meeting of the governing body and it was unanimously agreed that I should go with whosoever I wished. I chose the immediate past president. Although, I was mandated to represent the organization, my passport had expired ten years earlier and at that time, it was not an easy thing to secure a Nigeria passport at such short notice.

My previous passport was British. But as luck again would have it, (did I say luck?), as God had

===== Page 7 =====

18 Practical Clnissiay: The Celestial Church of Chnist Expeie 19

planned it, the assistant secretary who was a relation of the Chief of Staff Nigeria Army (it was during the military era) promised to procure the passport within the shortest possible time to meet the travelling arrangement and date. I left for Geneva, Switzerland exactly one week after the prophecy was given and I became a member of the Celestial Church of Christ.

On my return, I gave thanks to God and attended church regularly as a full- fledged member. Later, I was advised to acquire the white garment called soutane, which in CCC is graded depending on your rank. In CCC, you cannot wear or sew your garment in any form you like, it has to conform to what is laid down in order of ranks.

The lowest rank is the adena with your white garment loose at the arm length, you continue to move to higher ranks as you grasp the teachings and tenets of the church. Your devotion to worship is also put into consideration among other things. It was the habit of "Papa" Rev. S.B.J. Oschofa (of blessed memory) Pastor Founder of CCC to visit Makoko H.Q. of the church in Nigeria from the Republic of Benin. On such visits, the church leaders in Nigeria will present and introduce new members to him as a sign of the growth and acceptance of the church in Nigeria. It was on one of such visits that my wife and I were presented

to the pastor by the trio of Pastor Bada, Pa Ajanlekoko and Pa Cole (all of blessed memory).

That day, "Papa" as he was fondly called by all, asked us why we decided to join the Celestial Church of Christ. My reply was that the fellow who introduced the church to us told us that it is a church that is noted for:

- Friendship and love.- Honesty of purpose and deeds.- Being devoid of demonic practices.- Teaching of God's word based on the scripture as led by Holy Spirit.

He said that if that was our contention and reasons, so shall it be with us and we shall see the glory of God in our life. It happened as he predicted and that influenced my personal attachment to him throughout his lifetime. He was my spiritual father. I became more attached and involved with the church and I was persuaded to try and acquire the white garment. Although I was committed to the church, I still felt shy of wearing such dress in public because of what my friends would say.

However, I promised to get one on condition that I would be allowed to sew it like that of Pa Ajanlekoko

who was then a Senior Leader. He was an epitome of elegant and decent personality. It was then I learnt that in the CCC, you do not wear what style you like as was the practice in other white garment churches. You have to attain a certain level to wear a certain form of soutane in the CCC. Eventually my wife made an arrangement to get one for me, which I began to wear reluctantly.

When my friend whose wife introduced us to CCC, learnt that I have joined the CCC and saw me wear a soutane, he cleaned up his long abandoned soutane and started attending church services like me. During that time, prophecies were given freely and you did not have to go begging for it, nor was it hawked about. When messages were being given and you happen to be around there, if there is a message for you, they will just call you and deliver it. It could be a warning, or what to expect or whatever. The prophets were workers in the vineyard and they were paid by the church.

It was wonderful, joyful and rewarding to be a member of CCC Makoko. Then, the Headquarter of the church was a second home to most CCC members; you do not have to wait for service days to go there. It is like a meeting point where you can rub minds together spiritually and socially. Services are held on

Wednesdays and Fridays, usually referred to as day of mercy and power respectively. During the service, you are bound to experience wonderful works of healing and victories in all human endeavours. You leave the services a spiritually fulfilled person. That was when I began to be absent from beer parlours and drinking joints.

## Getting Entrenched in the Celestial Church of Christ

I would like to mention another particular incident that again endeared me to CCC at that early stage. One day, late Pastor Bada gave us a surprise visit at home in Majoro Street, Yaba. We were so elated that such an important leader could call on us. We were at a loss as to what to entertain him with, as the visit was impromptu. I therefore offered him brandy, whisky, etc. from our stock among other things. He, however, politely turned down everything and said he was just there to say hello to us as new members of the church. He did not go into preaching and condemning our style of living more especially when the church does not encourage the drinking of alcohol. This should serve as a lesson to new generation of pastors on how

to win and keep members; not by coercion or threat.

It was the tradition of CCC worldwide to converge at Port Novo for the church annual convention every 24 to 26 December. During this annual convention, many important decisions were discussed and concluded by the church hierarchy. Anointment was done on members to ascend to a higher rank in the lineage. Every member of CCC always looks forward to this get- together because of the various fascinating stories of how God used to grant most requests placed before Him during the convention.

I can testify to this because, it happened to us. Our first visit to Okun Ajase as it was generally referred to was in December 1971. It was a wonderful experience. It was there that I was told I would be moving base to Ibadan from Lagos and it came to pass. On return from this first trip to Port Novo, I had a brush with late Pastor Bada, then a Senior Evangelist.

As I mentioned earlier, business was booming for me and as an act of gratitude to God, I took permission from "Papa" that I wanted to paint the Makoko Church which was then under construction. He gave me the go- ahead if that was what I wanted. Little did I know I was treading on certain toes. While the painting was in progress, enquiries were made as to who was responsible for the job. When it was revealed to him that I was the person undertaking the work,

mocking my belief when things were really good for him suddenly found himself on the other side of life that smelt penury. He was keen to know what was responsible for my peace of mind that I always appear like somebody without worries in this world. He narrated his ordeals and all sorts of adversaries he had encountered, I told him to seek God for firm and active intervention. At first, he ignored me, but later, he went and joined the CCC of another branch. He told how he was delivered and had since been attending the church.

During one of the harvest thanksgiving service at Bodija Branch of CCC (Otakoya), I made him to give special thanks to God for His mercies. Within a year, God restored his fortunes; it was like a dream (Psalm 126). What a great testimony.

These are some of the unsolicited testimonies given by people who were not members of CCC.

## Movement from Lagos to Ibadan

We left for Ibadan that same year to continue our membership of CCC, at Yemetu, Western Nigerian Headquarters of the church. On arrival at Ibadan, we went straight to Yemetu for a special prayer of thanksgiving for safe arrival, because when the message was given at Okun Ajase, we were prophetically counselled to drive carefully because by the time we reach the outskirt of Ibadan, we might be involved in an accident. It could have happened but for the warning and the grace of God.

We travelled by way of Abeokuta because we had to see some people there. On getting to Command School area of Abeokuta/Ibadan road, I ran into a blind corner. Since I was not familiar with the road, I had to turn the vehicle in a way that jolted all the people in the car. We might have ended up in the bush.

===== Page 12 =====

28

We went straight to the church at Yemetu, and that was my first time of meeting the leader, the late Senior Evangelist Salako, a humble, and devoted gentleman. His type worked relentlessly for the progress of the church. May his soul rest in perfect peace. We continued attending the HQ of the church in Ibadan, but what I observed at the church at that time was the disparity between the congregation in Ibadan and that of Lagos. In Ibadan, members were not disposed to giving generously towards God's work and the benefit derived therefrom. Unlike Lagos where healthy rivalry was the order of the day, each person trying to beat the other to it all in the name, and to the glory of God, for his immense blessing and kindness. Also, the open-mindedness that prevailed in Lagos CCC was not visible at Yemetu. Instead, you will feel cold being in their midst.

Our first experience of such was when they first saw us in our soutane which we brought from Lagos. They kept quiet when they noticed that it was of a superior material to the plain ones recommended by the church. If they had asked, we would have explained why it was so. Instead, they waited until the Pastor and Founder visited Ibadan and reported us to him privately. They also informed him that we attended church regularly. As we arrived in church that Sunday,

Pracical Chisiriv: The Celsrial Churcch of Chnist Exprin 29

we were pointed out to Papa and to their dismay, Papa exclaimed: "these are my children from Lagos and I gave my blessing to what they were wearing"! The reply silenced them.

We continued our church services and worshipped in Ibadan with utmost devotion and commitment. Even though, I was travelling out of Ibadan most of the times on business, my wife and children continued with the type of activities we carried from Lagos to Ibadan. By virtue of her work as a staff member in Union Bank, she came in contact with most members of the church and that improved the relationship a bit. At our first harvest thanksgiving service in Ibadan, my wife was made the lady chairperson. Here, we were not disposed towards attending church on weekday's frequently as we did in Lagos due to:

Logistics problem, and Time factor

The erroneous belief is that when you are from Lagos, you are arrogant and dispose to lead such a fast life which they are not ready to contend with or accept. The brotherly atmosphere and friendship that prevailed at Makoko was completely absent. It was then that I began to have my experience with self- appointed prophets and prophetesses. One thing

===== Page 13 =====

happened at a Sunday service when a prophetess came to me during service and ordered me to get up and she began to rain insults on me on how arrogant I was, among other things. I was about to tell her off in the only language she could understand when a friend of mine who was sitting next to me who heard everything calmed me down.

That day, I realized that God does not abide in chaotic situation, because this same prophetess had spoken to my wife earlier which both of us did not know about but which would have caused commotion during service.

## CCC Rules and Regulations

W hen you become a member of the CCC, the rules and tenets of the church are recited to you, some of which are debatable, some questionable and some unacceptable, depending on the interpretation you are able to give to them and the logic they present.

Many unscrupulous shepherds are ready to stall you with the only slogan they are able to apply when they intend to have their ways, and that is "all sins are forgiven but any slander against the Holy Spirit is unforgivable." This, you may carry about in your mind until you encounter a more experienced leader who is versatile with the understanding and interpretation of the Holy Scriptures and its application. Some of the rules and regulations of the church are:

===== Page 14 =====

1. As a full-fledged member of CCC, it is mandatory that you go through water baptism. During this rite, the member undergoes spiritual rebirth by being immersed in the water of a small river or stream as a form of baptism that goes with the biblical injunction, but which has been changed by the orthodox churches, may be for convenience. (Matthew 3:13-17)

2. That you must not eat pork, snail, etc. a look into the scripture will make this very difficult to agree with, if you go by Romans 14:17-23, Acts 10:13-16 and Mark 7:18-23.

3. As a member of CCC, you should abstain from taking any drink that contains alcohol. I had the opportunity to inquire from the Pastor/Founder once, the reason for total abstinence, especially if Paul the Apostle could advise Timothy to drink wine because of his ill-health (1st Timothy 5:23) and Jesus Christ himself turned water to wine for the enjoyment of those at a wedding ceremony. I was informed that it was not meant for total abstinence but for the fact that people find self-control very difficult and the tendency

Practical Christianity: The Celestial Church of Christ Experience 33

to get addicted may result in unhealthy situation that can lead to dire consequence (Proverb 20:1).

4. You are to avoid adultery. But when one sees what is happening among the CCC congregations, you will be at a loss to explain when promiscuity becomes polygamy.

5. You are not to embrace or worship any other deity except God as manifested to Moses (Exodus 3:6).

6. You are not to seek help or solace from any diabolic power but stand by God and believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour.

Strict observance of the rules and regulations has proved to be highly rewarding. Adherence to them makes you stay radiant, healthy, happy and fulfilled in life. These are some of the rules and tenets, but as time went by, many prophets and prophetesses introduce their own doctrines into the system thus confirming the warning of Jesus Christ in Mark 7:7-8 and of Paul the Apostle in I Timothy 4:1-3.

## The CCC at Yemetu, Ibadan

A brotherhood in the CCC. The genuine love that radiated among members at that time was so much that people did not regret being associated with the church. But as time went by, intruders came under all forms of pretences and mischief started reigning supreme and the weaknesses of the leadership were exposed. They were overwhelmed by the influx of people they are unable to control, malpractices began to rear their ugly heads backed up by the root of all evils - love of money.

Suddenly, the church became interested in moneybags irrespective of the source of the money. Some were looking for a peace of mind with which to spend their ill- gotten wealth. People with self- imposed problems were looking for a way out of their predicaments. Never- do- well who dropped out of school and failed to learn a trade but were looking for

easy money became church workers. The leadership could not devise a way by which to control the reckless spread, may be because of the revenue that was coming in.

The CCC at that time was one solid block, the support for every church member was immense and members were so closely knit together that the uninformed referred to the organization as a cult. This is not so.

However, we made our presence felt at Yemetu branch by devotion and by bringing with us the type of CCC mode of brotherhood inherited from Makoko, Lagos. We had few friends and got many cold shoulders, but we were undaunted.

It was during one of such occasions that we attended the harvest thanksgiving service at the hometown of Pa Odelola, the then choirmaster of Yemetu choristers. Pa Odetola was a gentle, humble and very unassuming gentleman. In recognition of his outstanding performance in the church at Yemetu and CCC in general, all members were directed to attend the first harvest of the church in his hometown. It was at this harvest that I met again with Pastor Bada since we left Lagos and Makoko. He was surprised to see us and was overwhelmed that he had to inquire about our activities in the church, the response really made him happy.

## Movement from Yemetu to Odo-Ona CCC

Things went on like this until a branch was about to be established at Odo- Ona under the leadership of Pa Da- Silva, then the chairman of the parochial committee, CCC, Yemetu.

A retired civil servant, Pa Da- silva was respected by the church hierarchy, especially the Pastor/ Founder. He was one of those enlightened people and an amiable Orthodox Church member who joined the CCC. With his wealth of experience and ability to organize and bring expected sanity into CCC and make it a model, we decided to move out with him to found a CCC Chapter at Odo- Ona.

We began worshipping at Odo- Ona branch in the basement of the shepherd's house, who also doubles

as the patron. It was not easy at first but with devotion, perseverance and determination of the few that began service there, the church began to grow. Odo- Ona, Apata and Ago Tailor formed the main catchment area. The togetherness of people with the same objective "to worship God in spirit and in truth yielded good dividend". Judgment, the Bible says, will begin from the sanctuary. The warning becomes more apparent when it is discovered that most problems in the CCC starts with the shepherds, leaders and occupiers of high places in the church. It was therefore ironical that I had to begin my retreat from the Odo- Ona branch with all the hopes, aspirations and dreams I had for the church. I believe it was the will of God.

I cannot arrogate to myself the power of oration, but I believe to some extent, God really endowed me with some wisdom. This was profoundly brought to light at the CCC Odo- Ona, where I started preaching the gospel to church congregation and revival audience. It was at Odo- Ona branch that I began to abide by the rules and tenets of the church in its totality when responsibility was placed upon me and I knew that one has to live by example. It was an act of God.

Here, I want to sound a note of warning to Christians and converts. When they are about to get involved with any religious organization, they should

===== Page 17 =====

38 Practical Christianiry: The Celsial Church of Chais Expeni 39

seek divine guidance through prayer, that the Holy Spirit should reveal the true purpose for the establishment of such an organization. By so doing, the true agenda of whoever the motivator is would be made clear.

The church continued to grow in strength and in purpose of God. There was an influx of people from far and near and from all walks of life that within a short while, we were regarded as being "viable" by the headquarters in Lagos, which was the term used at the time to determine if a branch can stand on its own.

However, things began to fall apart when members decided that on our next visit to Okun Ajase for the annual convention, we should request for a prophet, which should be assigned to our branch by the CCC. It was the usual practice. Although the Shepherd headed the meeting where it was decided, little did we realize that it did not go down well with him. Besides, what influence I can muster to achieve such aim, I was there and then marked down for elimination.

Late Ta Shobowale was our Supervising Evangelist. He too was formerly from Makoko and my surprise, I was reported to him as someone aiding to bring down the church and wreak havoc on the congregation. He was also informed that they

do not know where we came from but admitted we were regular church attendants.

A meeting of the parochial committee was arranged secretly and fixed for one of the week- day service without our knowledge to catch us unawares. On the appointed day, Pa Shobowale was accompanied by Mama Shobowale, his wife. She was the one who first noticed us and was surprised and happy to see us. Then it was disclosed to them that we were the culprits. She was so surprised and found it unbelievable since we were their children at Makoko.

After listening to both parties, a parley was reached and both Pa and Mama Shobowale were convinced beyond doubt that we cannot do such thing because by that time, we were faithful CCC members.

## The Beginning of the End

The church continued to grow and the branch began to be reckoned with in the CCC organization. It also became the envy of many other branches.

It was customary for Papa (Pastor Founder) to come to Yemetu HQ of the church in Ibadan during every harvest celebration. During such visits, it was the pride and ambition of every branch to lure him to their church for prayers and blessing of their congregation.

At this particular harvest time, it was decided that the Pastor Founder should visit Odo- Ona branch for three main reasons:

It was the branch established by the first

Chairman of Yemetu HQ parochial committee;

It was a young branch that had grown so fast compared to the other branches set up about the same time; and To boost the ego of the church members as they come for prayer and blessing from Papa who most of them might be seeing personally for the first time.

The responsibility of achieving this herculean task was placed upon one Elder Akintoroye and me, because Papa was in very high demand. We started our strategy by paying a courtesy visit to Papa at Yemetu during which we intimated him with our desire that he should pay a visit to our branch. Late Pa Salako was present at the meeting but Papa could not give us a firm commitment at the time. But I was confident that with a word from Evangelist Salako and the love the Pastor Founder had for me, it should be possible if carefully handled and if we did not relent on our efforts.

Eventually, words came that Papa would visit us and that Akintoroye and myself will have to bring him down to the church at the appointed date. Therefore, what we did was to stay at Yemetu

overnight prior to the day. This was because, it was possible for someone more powerful and influential to take him away before our reaching there. This single act really impressed Papa and Pa Salako that in the morning, all other appointment were cancelled for the visit to Odo- Ona branch.

The words went round; members both old and new came from their workplaces to have a glimpse of Papa, some for the first time and to receive prayer and blessing of God through him. I must not fail to mention that Akintoroye and I were the first recipients of such prayer and blessing because earlier in the morning, during our vigil at Yemetu, we implored Papa to pray for us and bless the water we used that morning for bathing. This exemplary achievement, made Odo- Ona branch more popular not only in Ibadan, but also, in the western zone. Whenever anybody went to any branch and you mentioned that you are from Odo- Ona branch, the next word that would follow is Ha, Da- silva!

Meanwhile, our place of worship was becoming smaller and could not accommodate the growing number of worshippers. As a matter of fact, one of the remarks made by the Pastor Founder when he visited was that the place is very small for CCC congregation when the branch began to expand and if the chairman

will allow us to move out to a bigger place, then we will appreciate the difference.

On this, we decided to look for a bigger place and members were mandated to pursue the matter and report back their findings for consideration. Most of the places found were unsuitable for a church building and as such, we had to settle for one near the Shepherd's house, even though it was close to Odo- Ona river.

A new church building was constructed accompanied by crisis upon crisis, which is not unusual. By that time, I had achieved the title of a rebel and troublemaker, because I found it very difficult to close my eyes or look the other way when the truth was being suppressed; and malicious and wicked machinations were being encouraged and acknowledged. The church was gradually becoming commercialized and some were hellbent on keeping it so. This was the situation by the time we moved into the new building at Odo- Ona. At the time we moved into the new building, power failure had become the order of the day and when this happened during services, it became very uncomfortable to concentrate, apart from being thrown into darkness. The atmosphere becomes very hot. Therefore, something had to be done but unfortunately, the

congregation had been stretched to the limit, both financially and physically.

It was as a result of this that some leaders put heads together to procure a generator for the church and implored whoever was willing to join in making voluntary contributions. The main movers at that time were Leader Bejide, Leader Akeredolu and I. Elder Adebosin who was made the protean treasurer having signified his intention to participate.

We made an enquiry and found that UTC could supply us with a generator, which will be suitable for our need and at an affordable cost. Since it is better to live by example, we the movers tasked ourselves and in matter of days, we were able to raise enough to deposit for the generator before putting it before the congregation. The response was spontaneous because they believed it was a good course worthy of support. Within one week, we have collected enough to pay for the generator.

Then crisis raised its ugly head again. The shepherd impounded the money collected and instigated the youth to say they were not ready to purchase generator and that their priority was a fence around the church. With this, the idea of a generator was cancelled for block- making, which we were not aware of. The idea to cancel came when the shepherd

Pracical Christianiy: The Celestial Church of Christ Experience 47 saw that money came in for the purchase of the generator. He was determined to fight the course to a logical conclusion.

In a situation like this, many would like to sit on the fence and watch what the outcome would be. The prime movers were left alone to sort it out. Our first step was to enquire from the protean treasurer what happened to the money collected for the generator. His reply was that the Shepherd collected the money from him and promised to address the church about it. We made him to understand that the money is not for the church but a voluntary contribution for a specific purpose (generator). After that, we decided to meet the Shepherd to know why he decided to collect the amount contributed. We met a brickwall. He told us that he passed the money to the treasurer of the church and that it would be used for another purpose.

We went to see the church treasurer who also doubles as the Patron of the church to explain the situation to him and secure his support for the venture. We again ran into a brickwall, I even pleaded with him and went down on my knees because I did not want a situation whereby he would feel offended. He was unyielding and even went further to inform me that he had deposited the money in bank. I was surprised because no bank opened at the time on

===== Page 22 =====

48 Practical Christianity: The Celestial Church of Christ Expe nce Saturday. I could understand the position of the treasurer/patron because he was of the same age group with the shepherd and he did not want to rock the boat.

Therefore, I had no alternative but to take the matter to the Supervising Evangelist in the western zone, Pa Salako. I was even determined that if the issue is not resolved, I would leave the CCC. Pa Salako acted promptly, he came to our branch and called for an emergency meeting of the parochial committee. After listening to both parties, he resolved that since the money was a special contribution for a specific purpose, it must be used for the purpose and should not be mixed with the church's account. He even went further that the Pastor Founder would not take kindly to such an action.

We bought the generator, though at a slightly higher price than originally quoted. It was a big relief to all and the capacity of the generator was enough to supply power to the church and the shepherd's house. From that time, plans were hatched to get us out of the church by insinuations, instigations and manipulations of people within the congregation. Some agreed to string along not because they were convinced that what we were doing was wrong but out of envy and jealousy. They saw us as an impediment to their hidden agenda. The opportunity

came when proposals were made to expand the church building because the existing one could no longer accommodate the growing number of worshippers. The detractors were asked to put on their PHD (Pull Him Down) gowns. But if God is on our side, what can anybody do to us? (Psalm 118:6- 7)

Some were in support of moving out entirely from our present site, while others were in support of remaining on the present site but expand the church, but before we can do that, we must consult the Ministry of Environment because of our nearness to Odo- Ona river and the government channelisation programme. Again the onus was on me to link up with the Ministry of Environment. I met with the officials of the ministry and an appointment was made for an inspection of the site. They were carried out in the presence of all leading members of the church and few days later, we received a letter from the ministry that we cannot carry out the expansion programme on the site because it was too close to the river and the channelisation programme will affect our church building.

Although the letter was read and made available to the parochial committee, I was reported to the Supervising Evangelist that I was hatching a plan to destroy the church building in connivance with the

===== Page 23 =====

50 Practical Christianity: The Celestial Church of Christ ExpeRITeC

Ministry of Environment. All these were done in an effort not to leave the old site. It was after this incident that I had a fatal accident during my normal course of duty. What a coincidence!! I fell from the roof of a two- storey building, broke my leg and was hospitalized for almost one year.

There were rumours as to the cause of my accident and some even confronted me with the rumour, but I dismissed same as coincidental. I however, made one statement, that "church is supposed to be the house of God where people go to worship and should not be used to plan evil. But if it did, it will not stand." During a severe rainfall and storm, the church building was swept away by flood. When I recovered fully, I had a thanksgiving service at the temporary wooden church erected in place of the old church.

"Pray and I will say Amen" is the concept some believe in so much, that they make sure they do not get involved with the activities of the church that they attend and as such bury their God- given talents which, if fully applied, can be beneficial to fellow human beings to the glory of God. We know very well we cannot all be pastors, apostles or evangelists, etc but we can make ourselves in one way or another useful to God, the creator of heaven and earth (1 Corinthians 12:27- 31).

Regrettably, some church leaders are so

overridden with pride that they even arrogate to themselves the power of life and death over their congregation, so much so that some of their members do not have confidence in what they believe in (God) any more. There are some who believe that God's kingdom is for sale to the highest bidder and that hell is for those who cannot comply. They start to preach prosperity, and force their listeners to submission. Salvation of the soul has been relegated to the background and made obscure. Definitely, the end time is here.

## False Prophets and Prophetesses in CCC

One of the strong pillars of CCC is prophecy. Unfortunately, this aspect of the pillar like some others has become so uncontrollably polluted and commercialized that it has lost its sense of direction. It is the ambition of nearly every member of CCC now to become a prophet or prophetess. It is like in the new generation churches where everybody wants to speak in tongues, even if they cannot translate same to the benefit of their congregation (I Corinthians 14:13- 19).

Some prophets and prophetesses have done a lot to bring the good name of CCC to disrepute. They have caused disaffection among families and church members. A typical example was a prophet who gave

a message to a lady who is looking to God for the blessing of the womb. What would have been a thing of joy to the lady became a nightmare. She left the church as a result of this.

Her ordeal began when she was about carrying out the spiritual message she was given. She was to bathe in a stream with some ingredients peculiar to CCC. The prophet was to follow her to the stream where prayers and other rituals were to be carried out. After the prayer and bathing in the stream, the prophet proposed adultery to her in such a crude and debasing manner that the woman raised an alarm, ran to the church and reported to the authority. When the prophet was queried about the incident, his reply was that it was the work of the devil.

Here, let me digress a bit. Establishing a church nowadays is not as it was in the days of early missionaries. In those days, churches were established to reform, educate and bring mankind nearer to God for redemption and salvation of soul. To establish the awareness of God and his goodness by giving us his Son, Jesus Christ as ransom for our sins (John 3:16). But what do we have now, preaching of prosperity and commercialization of God's gifts. Most religious leaders now regard pastoral duties as profession and not call. There is a Yoruba saying that "Tienia ba mo

===== Page 25 =====

54 PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY: THE CELESIAL CHURCH OF CHRIST EXPERIENCE 55

Jesus pe, o ta ju koko lo" meaning: "If you are a powerful orator and can speak about Jesus, it is now a more profitable venture than cocoa" (the main export produce of Nigeria before the advent of crude oil).

The slogan that is being used to cajole the unsuspecting and ignorant follower is to be "born again," an idea which most cannot even explain in detail. Religion in Christendom has been made very controversial in the world today as a result of so many doctrines being introduced into it and the breaking up into factions for selfish tendencies, using the name of Jesus Christ as a unifying factor. Most leaders seek God in words and not in deeds (John 6:25- 28). They fashioned out names from the scripture by which their church is called. It is true that most of us have followed lesser gods in the past, like for example, in my own part of the world among ethnic group,

God is referred to as Olodumare Angles are referred to as Anjanu Spirit is referred to as Oro

But if we can go by Paul Apostle, in 1 Corinthians 12:1- 3, we can then learn from our past and appreciate Jesus Christ. See also, Isaiah 26:13. Therefore, we should agree that the Bible is inspired word of God

and is acceptable, Paul apostel (II Timothy 3:19- 17). He also, rested the case of acceptability of God as the Supreme Being in his address to the Athenians, who were in the habit of worshipping unknown gods in Acts 17:22.

Back to the prophets and prophetesses, how can one explain this funny and bizarre experience to an outsider or a new convert when a message was given to a sick woman that to get healed of her sickness, the following has to be carried out:

(a) Prepare sugarcanes, coconut, adun and eggs, etc into a bowl.

(b) Seven elders should surround it and say prayers of forgiveness and cure with the sick woman kneeling down.

(c) The said bowl has to be carried to a crossroad where another round of prayers has to be said by the seven elders with the sick woman again kneeling down beside it right at the crossroad around 12 midnight.

While the above were about to be carried out, a police patrol team was coming and on citing them, they stopped and drove all of them away from the spot with insulting words directed against the church. This really happened.

## Movement to CCC Apata

While I was convalescing after my accident, I was approached by some members (Odo- Ona branch) that a new branch is about to be formed at Apata, Ibadan and that the prime mover who was based in Lagos would like to attract genuine worshippers which is part of his covenant with God in establishing the branch.

We had a lengthy and factual discussion as to why we should move to the new branch. Thereafter, a meeting was arranged with the prime mover in Lagos who in turn agreed tentatively to our pioneering the running of the church after another mind- rubbing episode to ensure we both understand the task ahead. Before we can formalize our agreement, approval had to be obtained from the Pastor Founder.

To get such things done, it was mandatory to go

through the head of Nigeria Diocese, Supreme Evangelist Bada, who was to ensure that all protocols were observed and followed before recommending such approval to the Pastor Founder.

Several visits were made to Ketu headquarters of the church before the final approval was given during a meeting of the trustees council. By that time, I was all right to move around and was opportuned to follow the delegation to get the final approval. Here, I must mention the supporting role of Superior Evangelist Ajankekoko. The new branch was opened and the first service there took place on a Wednesday. Little did I realized that there was a scramble for the new branch among the CCC hierarchy unit, we began to worship there and emissaries were being sent as to who would control it.

Where two of my main reasons for wanting to move to the new branch were:

The situation at Odo- Ona branch became so frustrating that having such a new branch will provide succour to worship freely without hindrance or rancour. I was wrong. Our proposed personal house is to be established at Apata, which would make it convenient to be near the church. God made that possible.

===== Page 27 =====

58 Practical Christianity: The Celestial Church of Christ Experience 59

It was the intention of the pioneer members to put church on a very sound footing before requesting for a full time shepherd, but the pressure from many leaders of the church was so immense that I began to wonder what it has to do with running a church. We warded off the pressure by informing them politely that when we were ready for a full time shepherd, we shall inform Ketu headquarters to send someone.

God was on our side and the church continued to grow with complete dedication and devotion by the pioneers, working indefatigably to see the church become a role model in conformity with the CCC doctrine. The pioneer leaders were all in gainful employment and we made it mandatory for each of us to come straight to church after each day's work, to assist and attend to the needs of members. They were all very committed. All along, the desire to control the church by some leaders in CCC did not stop, but they now employed the tactics of remote control by sending their agents with messages that Ketu asked them to come and shepherd the church without any authentic letter to that effect. They were politely sent back.

There was the case of a man who suddenly turned up in flowing "soutane" and went straight to the mercy land and started running.

whole place. When he was asked about his mission to the place, he replied that he was directed by the Holy Spirit to come and shepherd the church and one of his first duty was to weed the mercy land and clean it. We did not dispute his story but made it clear to him that we need a letter from headquarters, at Ketu. That was the last we saw of him, but later we got to know who sent him.

## Trouble at CCC Apata

Meanwhile, the branch continued to grow and we were witnessing increase in membership. It was time to request for a full time shepherd. Ketu responded by sending us a "Woleader" being another name for a prophet. Also, there was need to have a supervising evangelist and we all decided on late Superior Woleader Adekambi, a versatile, forward- looking and hardworing individual.

We decided on him among other interesting groups because he was young, progressive and dedicated to the advancement of the work of God, which brought army barracks to its enviable position. He started the branch from scratch and with nothing.

The shepherd sent from Ketu was received by all members and was assured of good cooperation from the congregation. Naturally, one would expect him to

Practical Christianity: The Celestial Church of Christ Experience 61 have ideas of what he wanted to achieve for both himself and the church and this was taken into consideration by giving him free hand to operate within the ambit of the church tenets and scripture.

Apparently, his intentions were diabolical; this was brought into the open by a convert who was a night watchman and an ardent idol worshipper who decided to become a member, when God revealed Himself to him during one of his night duties. This man was so close to the shepherd and wanted to be of service to him and the church wherever possible, he was also, a native of the shepherd's hometown. He would send him on errands and would carry out minor works for him.

On this particular occasion, he went to assist the Woleader on the mercy ground and saw him reciting some incantations on a piece of paper on which was written some names and a big stone placed on it with strip of palm leaves usually referred to as ida. The attention of one of the church members was drawn to it during a chit- chat and the member wanted to know what it was all about, but to his surprise and disappointment, it was the names of all the pioneering members that was in the sheet of paper and the accompanying prayer was that they should all disappear and scatter like broomstick to give him

===== Page 29 =====

62 PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY: THE CELESTIAL CHURCH OF CHRIST EXPERIENCE 63

absolute control. He was confronted with the allegation, which he denied naturally. He was however, warned to desist from such actions and follow his call and his duties.

Most of these so called Olusogutan (shepherds) do not realize that we may not all be shepherds, evangelists, etc, but we have a gift bequeathed to us by the Almighty God Himself (I Corinthians 12:7- 11). Unfortunately, he did not heed the warning; rather he became hostile to the church leaders and carried on doing his own thing the way he pleases. However, things came to a head when he had the effrontery to report us to the Supervising Evangelist that we were embezzling the money collected by the church. These were grave allegations and the Supervising Evangelist called an emergency meeting of the church committee and requested for the accounts to be made available. He was accompanied by the treasurer and secretary of his church (army barracks branch).

At the meeting, the Shepherd was asked to repeat his allegations against the church leaders and he repeated the same. We were requested to submit the account of the church to both the treasurer and secretary that accompanied the Supervising Evangelist and they were mandated to go through the books thoroughly. After a thorough check of the

books and the returns, they reported to the meeting "if the record and the accounting system of most CCC branches were so kept, there will be little or no squabble in the CCC concerning monetary matters". The panel were surprised at the outcome and it is now our turn to let them know the type of Olusogutan we had to put up with:

- Embarrassing situation, the branch was put into by his incessant borrowing of money from every Tom, Dick and Harry.- Fraudulent conversion of money contributed by members for the baptism that was to take place at Ketu headquarters of the church.- How the church leaders had to cough-up the amount for the baptism so as not to let the members known about what had happened to their contribution.

He was asked to substantiate the above allegations. He confirmed all and promised to pay back. There and then, the Supervising Evangelist asked him what he was doing before accepting to work in the vineyard and he was ashamed to answer. Information obtained showed that he was an illegal driver, plying between Idiroko and Cotonou. The committee closed in dismay and he was transferred.

## Irredeemable Slide to Chaos

Such was the situation before another shepherd was posted to the branch. A self- aggrandizing lazy and faithless character that had eyes for everything good but cannot work for them. He was into removing every good things offered for thanksgiving to his apartment as part of his personal belongings. He believed so much in the practice of divide and rule and used the spirit of gossip to achieve his mischievous ambition.

When members approached him for spiritual and visionary guidance, they will be instructed to cut pieces of paper and fold them into balls, put them in a basin or bowl and take their pick, whatever they took, became their lots. What a way to be a shepherd. Then I realized that like in all fields of life, there still exists in

Practical Christianity: The Celestial Church of Christ Experience 65

Christendom, Alexanders, the coppersmith, Bar Jesus, Simon the sorcerer, etc. in 2000 A.D.

This same shepherd went ahead and created around himself, so many false prophets and prophetesses, who were ready to deliver messages he wanted to hear. He was very fond of saying that "not all those who started a CCC branch always end up there". He was right, because when the situation in a place does not conform to your avowed intention, you are bound to leave. It is very important to pray for a discerning spirit when these prophets and prophetesses are into their acts to be able to differentiate falsehood from true prophecy and the interpretation of different messages. They do not possess absolute knowledge of interpretation of their messages, therefore, one has to be careful, lest one is misled.

Take for example; a message that was given that a certain community should guide against an incident which may cause a situation whereby families will run away and abandon their abode. Within two weeks, the prophecy came to pass and the whole community was taken by surprise. Solution has to be found, some very drastic, which could lead to chaos. Some remembered the prophecy concerning the situation and at the same time proffered, a drastic approach. However, they went into dialogue with the affected people. A peaceful agreement was reached and

===== Page 31 =====

66 Practical Christianity: The Cultural Church of Christ, Expositor,

disastrous consequences were averted and they all continued to live in peace.

Back to the shepherd, consequent upon his actions, discipline and orderliness broke down among the congregation and everybody was doing his or her own thing. False prophecies reigned supreme most especially against those who were opposed to his method of running the church. Moves were made to remove the church's account from the existing bank so as to give him and his cohorts free access to spending.

Although this was achieved, but not until all money owned the bank were paid back to the chagrin of those clamouring for a change of bank. In the CCC, if you are not satisfied with any message given or not clear as to its implications, you have every right to approach any of the respected and spirit- filled leaders for clarification.

This was the situation when I was given certain messages and I decided to refer it to the Pastor Founder. When I made this known to the shepherd, he was perturbed and became concerned about what may be the consequences of such messages. He appealed to me to disregard the messages and sent emissaries to dissuade me from taking the matter to the headquarters. He promised that such a thing would never happen again.

## 17

## The End of the Road

That day I became worried about what will be the future of CCC, a church which was believed to have been sent by God to bring peace, love, joy and salvation to this troubled world. CCC was gaining ground in several countries of the world, talkless of Nigeria. It was the envy of other churches. I can testify to this because when I was a member, many times, I had been taken up by members of other churches and pastors during chit- chat as to what was in the CCC that many people were flocking into it. By the time I finish talking to them about CCC, they were always dumbfounded and short of what to say. Many who would not want to have anything to do with white garment churches would just suddenly find themselves in CCC. That time it was a pride to be called a member of the CCC.

===== Page 32 =====

65 Paeical Chnistainy: The Cttlal Chnist Expniet

The discord and fragmentation were unfortunately assisted by some certain individuals who could have used their position to bring sanity to the ugly situations created by the so- called Olusogatun and prophets but failed to act.

Finally, I and some other members eased ourselves out of the branch and the CCC in general. It was joy galore among some members and the shepherd himself. They gladly announced to whoever was ready to listen that Superior Senior Leader Alabi and others have left the church; their centre could not hold any longer. Spiritual guidance and decorum were thrown out of the church with ignominy. Here, let me state categorically that I am not ashamed of having been a member of the CCC.

The duties assigned to me by God were accomplished and my aim achieved. I discovered that if God is worshipped in spirit and in truth, His presence could always be felt in one's life. He had made it possible for goodness and mercy to follow me and my family all the days of our lives, and we will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever and ever, Amen. Halleluyah O! Halleluyah O!!

## Postscript

E establishing churches is now the order of the day in Nigeria. But teaching of the word of God is not comprehensive enough in some church organizations to portray practical Christianity as preached by Rabbi Jesus Christ and the Apostles. For example, when Jesus Christ was about to be crucified, it became so hard and burdensome for him to carry the cross. The Roman soldier around him did not consider it fit to allow a fellow Roman to carry the burden of the cross but called on an African from Libya who was sojourning in Rome to carry it. It should be a significant impact in the religious life of Africans if you consider Jesus Christ's words in Matthew 27:32. But the relevance was played down by early Christian ministers and the new generation of pastors. May be this irony of fate is why, in spite of our iniquities, God's goodness is still over us in Africa.

Songs are supposed to be soul inspiring, but what do we have nowadays, abusive songs inviting directly, the devil into the lives of fellow human beings.
